# Sales Dashboard
Quantum Analytics Sales Dashboard done with Excel


Excel dashboard visualization created using a sales data provided by Quantum Analytics NG.

This sales data was cleaned and transformed by me before I used it to create the Quantum Analytics NG Sales Dashboard below generating different insights including:
- Total revenue, total quantity and total number of manufacturer
- Sales trend in millions
- Top ten(10) products by revenue in thousand
- Trend by units/quantity
- Top three(3) states in Revenue generation in millions.
- Revenue contribution by category.

A little more explanations has been made in the various visuals in the dashboard.
